# Animated Button
Custom button node that gives you some basic hover animations by default for scale and position.

# How to use
1. Simply download the addon from release tab and copy it in your `res://addons` folder.
2. Then enable the plugin from the project settings.
3. And finally a new custom node called `AnimatedButton` will appear when creating a new node.

# Properties Overview:
`Duration` -> Its the duration for each animation

`animate_scale` ->  Check if you wanna animate the scale property of button.

`animate_position` -> Check if you wanna animate the position property of button.

`Scale Properties` ->  `intensity` ->  It is the scale hover value, set this according to your desired scale value.

`Position Properties` -> `position_value` -> It is the position hover value, the button will animate to this position from its previous position.

This custom node is still being worked on and is very basic as of now. Im going to add more stuff into it while keeping it simple and easy to use.

# Ideas for future:
- Add custom properties to animate.
- Enter and exit animations like fade, pop etc.
